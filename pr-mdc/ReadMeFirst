PR-MDC

  Classical molecular dynamics code implementing the
  Parrinello-Rahman's method for the pressure regulation.

  The code was developed by the TEAM IEMD project.
  See also the manual file contained in the MDC (classical molecular
  dynamics calculation program). 

  Be aware that the code is still little bit buggy. ;-)
