single- & double- walled nanotube

the function in order to create a structure of a single- or
double-walled carbon nanotube.

     multiwall_nanotube( int i, int n1, int m1, int n2, int m2 )

where

i      --> the number of walls which construct a tube. ( 1 or 2 )
           1 : single-walled carbon nanotube.
           2 : double-walled carbon nanotube.
n1, m1 --> chiral indecs of the inner tube.
n2, m2 --> chiral indecs of the outer tube.
           ( n2 may not equate n1, or m2 may not equate m1. )
