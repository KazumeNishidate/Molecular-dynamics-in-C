TBMDC-localize

  O(N) Tight-binding Molecular Dynamics simulation code
  
  The code utilize the Fermatrix diagonalization method together 
  with the Localization approach. These strategies effectively 
  reduce the number of complicated calculations and realize
  the order N computational method.

  The code was developed by the TEAM IEMD project.
  See also the manual file contained in the MDC (classical molecular
  dynamics calculation program).
